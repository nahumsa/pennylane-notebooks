- [Meta-VQE](https://github.com/nahumsa/pennylane-notebooks/blob/main/Meta-VQE%20Pennylane.ipynb) : The Meta-VQE algorithm is a variational quantum algorithm that is suited for NISQ devices and encodes parameters of a Hamiltonian into a variational ansatz which we can obtain good estimations of the ground state of the Hamiltonian by changing only those encoded parameters.
- [Variational Quantum Classifier](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nahumsa/pennylane-notebooks/blob/main/VQC_Pennylane.ipynb) : The Variational Quantum Classifier is a Hybrid Quantum-Classical algorithm that is used to classify data.
